# Street-Combats (Street-style-fighting-game using Python and Pygame)
No Problem! Here is the information about the "Street Fighter Style Fighting Game" built using Python and Pygame. This project showcases the essential elements of creating a 2D fighting game from the ground up. Beginning with setting up the game environment, the project involves structuring files, importing necessary libraries, and initializing a responsive game window.
The project's main focus is to bring characters to life by incorporating attack functionalities and collision detection, resulting in engaging and realistic battles. In the final stage, vibrant sprite animations are integrated to give fighters distinct personalities and enhance the game's visual appeal.
This project represents an excellent example of Python game development, resulting in a fully functional fighting game. It provides valuable insights into coding practices and design principles that are essential for successful game projects.
# Summary
## üñ• Character Orientation: 
The project development continues by refining the character orientation so that both characters face each other correctly, with the wizard's initial facing direction adjusted to match the warrior. 
## ‚è± Animation Timing and Updates: 
The development goes into detail on how to handle animation updates, ensuring that each frame of the animation is displayed for the correct amount of time, such as half a second per frame.
## ü§∫ Implementing Attacks and Hits: 
The project focuses on creating various attack animations and linking them to specific actions within the game. It also involves implementing hit animations for when a character is struck and ensuring that the game logic resets these animations appropriately. 
## ‚öî  Adding Cooldowns and Attack Logic: 
A cooldown mechanism is added to prevent players from spamming attacks, making gameplay more strategic. The project also includes logic to reset animations after attacks and hits, ensuring that characters return to idle or other states correctly. 
## üéº Sound Effects and Music Integration: 
The final stages of the project involve adding sound effects for attacks and background music to enhance the game's atmosphere. This will require using Pygame's mixer module to load and play audio files, and making volume adjustments and setting the music to loop.
